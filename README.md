CSCE 315 Project 3: Android Application
=============

### Build Notes

In order to use the Google Maps API, you must use the [attached keyfile](debug.keystore). You must also follow the instructions on Google's site for integrating Google Play services into an android application.

### TDD in Interface Design

Because our app's UI is relatively simple, TDD was not enormously useful during the interface design stage. It is being used to ensure that every button connects the activities to each other, but doesn't serve much of a purpose aside from this yet.

### App Screenshots
